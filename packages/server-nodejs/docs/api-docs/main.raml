          Rename and/or copy/move file/dir to destination

          When moving a file/dir, parents array has destination parent ID only.
          name, if specified, gives a new name in destination.

          When copying a file/dir, parents array has both current parent ID
          and destination parent ID (order is irrelevant).
          name, if specified, gives a new name in destination.
          When copying inside parent dir, parents array may have either
          one parent ID or parent ID repeated twice.

          When renaming a file/dir, parents parameter is not set or empty array.

          If target exists, the file/dir is copied/moved with suffix (<number>),
          where number is tried with 1, 2, etc. untill first free name is found.
